Assignment #04: Interactive Movie with Animated Character
Movie Theme: Preconception and ungratefulness
-----

## Introduction

The inspiration for this story comes from the escalating contradiction between doctors and patients since the outbreak of coronavirus. Doctors and nurses did their best to treat the patients, but some still blame medical staff for curing themselves completely.

My short film tells the story of a monster helping the villagers while being regarded as a destructive bad attacker by the villagers, and ultimately the village is in danger. It not only tells us not to bite the hand that feeds one, but also not judge people by appearance.
The realization of the project is based on the unreal engine, using sequencer to create cinematics. Characters and scenes are mainly Paragon downloaded from epic games.
